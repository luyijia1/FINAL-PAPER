# Potential influencing factors of the total compensation of top three executives
This repo is going to be the discussion of potential influencing factors of the total compensation of top three executives in developing countries. In this case, the study is focused on China. 

The motivation is that it turns to be the time for our undergraduates to find jobs and start our career management. In employment, except for the salary factor, human capital is also known gradually as the basic core of group enterprises. As for human resource management, the most essential part is the compensation management, especially that of senior management. Therefore, I would like to analyze different factors that might affect the total compensation of top three executives in the company. The data will be collected through CSMAR database to find possible influencing factors. 

At first, the data is downloaded in XLSX version (file called data.xlsx) and I converted it into CSV version in order to import into R studio. I have attached the RAWDATA.csv in the DATA file. The data of several variables were treated with logarithm and the processed data were saved in the Process Data.csv. The VariableTable.csv is the final dataset being used in creating diagrams and plots, and for analyzing.
