# FINAL-PAPER
This repo is going to be the final project. 

The motivation is that it turns to be the time for our undergraduates to find jobs and start our career management. In employment, except for the salary factor, human capital is also known gradually as the basic core of group enterprises. As for human resource management, the most essential part is the compensation management, especially that of senior management. 

I would like to analyze different factors that might affect the total compensation of top three executives in the company. 

The data will be collected through CSMAR database to find possible influencing factors.
